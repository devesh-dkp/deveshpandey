      <p className="text-lg text-gray-600 mb-6">
        I'm Devesh Kumar Pandey, with a strong quantitative and analytical background shaped through
        formal training in Mathematics and Computing at IIT Patna, followed by management education
        at IIM Mumbai. This combination has helped me develop structured thinking and a data-first
        approach to problem solving.
      </p>

      <p className="text-lg text-gray-600 mb-6">
        Through live industry and academic projects, I have worked on predictive modeling, AI-based
        forecasting, risk and variability analysis, workforce optimization, and performance analytics.
        These projects involved working with noisy data, building assumptions, stress-testing
        outcomes, and translating analytical results into practical recommendations.
      </p>

      <p className="text-lg text-gray-600 mb-6">
        My technical toolkit includes Python, R, SQL, and applied statistical techniques, with a
        focus on modeling, scenario analysis, and decision support rather than descriptive reporting.
        I place strong emphasis on understanding downside risk, trade-offs, and the implications of
        analytical decisions.
      </p>

        Current Focus
      </h2>
      <p className="text-lg text-gray-600 mb-6">
        I am focused on building a career in analytically intensive roles within finance and
        risk-oriented domains, where structured thinking, modeling under uncertainty, and ownership
        of outcomes are central. I am keen to work in environments that value depth of analysis,
        learning velocity, and long-term impact.
